# Component Library

A simple, modular component library featuring Navbar, Login, and Footer components built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
/components
  /navbar
    index.html
    navbar.js
  /login
    index.html
    login.js
  /footer
    index.html
    footer.js
index.html        # Root file to compose all components
main.js           # Root JS to load components
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the composed app with all components.
3. Each component can also be used standalone by opening its `index.html`.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The root `index.html` contains empty containers for each component.
- `main.js` dynamically loads each component's HTML and JS into the root page.
- Components are styled with Tailwind CSS via CDN.

## 🧩 Customization

- To add or modify a component, edit its folder's `index.html` and JS file.
- Add new components by following the same folder structure.

## 🏗️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- JavaScript (ES modules)
